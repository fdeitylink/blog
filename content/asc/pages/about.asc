Hi!

I'm Brian "fdeitylink" Christian. Welcome to my programming blog!

I've been programming in my free time since 2014 and semi-professionally since 2016. Currently I am working towards a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the Rochester Institute of Technology.

I write about a number of topics across the programming spectrum, including https://github.com/fdeitylink?tab=repositories[my own projects], developer news, musings/rants on different subjects, and anything else as I see fit.

My interests include:

* programming languages
* compilers and interpreters
* functional programming
* theoretical computer science

I've worked with a variety of languages, including Java, Kotlin, and Clojure, the latter being my current favorite.

Be sure to read my blog if any of this interests you!
